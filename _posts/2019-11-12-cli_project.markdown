Ths CLI project I did was a very simple app that pulled current drug shortages from a website. The user would run the program and be prompted to type 1 of 4 selections:

1 current drug shortages
2 resolved drug shortages
3 list- list of the choices user can make
4 exit

This was really a super hard project when you got the hang off it, but it definately was difficult at times. I ran into an issue with iterating through the css, which prints the drugs in a jumbled way, but side from that issue I think it worked well.
