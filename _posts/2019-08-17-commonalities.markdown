Actually coding to me is like nothing else i've ever done.  In a way its hard to compare. I work in a pharmacy and I will say these two are like apples and oranges but I will say I have found one thing they share and that is attention to detail. In pharmacy obviously you have to pay attention to everything about a medicine as to not give the worng thing to the wrong patient. Coding is much like that, I have found that one small mistake or extra something can mess up your code completely. So it is very important to pay attention to what you type as it is very important in pharmacy to pay attention to medicine.
